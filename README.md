This program scrapes the addresses, prices per month, and Zillow links for rental properties in a given area. In my
project, I'm using Buffalo, NY as my example. Once the required information is scraped off of Zillow, it is entered into
a Google form, which once submitted, formats it into a spreadsheet.
